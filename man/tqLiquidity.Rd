\section{Details}{
The respective liquidity measures are defined as follows:
\itemize{
\item{es: effective spread}{
\deqn{
\mbox{effective spread}_t =  2*D_t*(\mbox{PRICE}_{t} - \frac{(\mbox{BID}_{t}+\mbox{OFR}_{t})}{2}),
}
where \eqn{D_t} is 1 (-1) if \eqn{trade_t} was buy (sell) (see Boehmer (2005), Bessembinder (2003)). 
Note that the input of this function consists of the matched trades and quotes,
 so this is were the time indication refers to (and thus not to the registered quote timestamp).
} 
\item{rs: realized spread}{ 
\deqn{
\mbox{realized spread}_t =  2*D_t*(\mbox{PRICE}_{t} - \frac{(\mbox{BID}_{t+300}+\mbox{OFR}_{t+300})}{2}),
}

where \eqn{D_t} is 1 (-1) if \eqn{trade_t} was buy (sell) (see Boehmer (2005), Bessembinder (2003)). 
Note that the time indication of \eqn{\mbox{BID}} and \eqn{\mbox{OFR}} refers 
to the registered time of the quote in seconds.

Note that the input of this function consists of the matched trades and quotes,
 so this is were the time indication refers to (and thus not to the registered quote timestamp).
