\title{Ten artificial time series for the NYSE trading days during January 2010}
\description{
Ten simulated price series for the 19 trading days in January 2010:

Ten hypothetical price series were simulated 
according to the factor diffusion process discussed in Barndorff-Nielsen et al.
We assume that prices are only observed when a transaction takes place. 
The intensity of transactions follows a Poisson process and consequently,
the inter transaction times are exponentially distributed. 
Therefore, we generated the inter transaction times of the price series 
by an independent exponential distributions with lambda = 0.1,
which we keep constant over time. This means we expect one transaction every ten seconds.
In a final step, the time series were aggregated to the 5-minute frequency by previous tick aggregation.
