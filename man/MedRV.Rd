MedRV
}
\description{
Function returns the MedRV, defined in Andersen et al. (2009).

Let \eqn{r_{t,i}} be a return (with \eqn{i=1,\ldots,M}) in period \eqn{t}.

Then, the MedRV is given by
\deqn{
\mbox{MedRV}_{t}=\frac{\pi}{6-4\sqrt{3}+\pi}\left(\frac{M}{M-2}\right) \sum_{i=2}^{M-1} \mbox{med}(|r_{t,i-1}|,|r_{t,i}|, |r_{t,i+1}|)^2
}

\usage{
MedRV(data)
}

\arguments{
  \item{data}{ a zoo/xts object containing all returns in period t for one asset. }
}

\section{Details}{

The MedRV belongs to the class of realized volatility measures in RTAQ 
that use the series of high-frequency returns \eqn{r_{t,i}} of a day \eqn{t} 
to produce an ex post estimate of the realized volatility of that day \eqn{t}. 
MedRV is designed to be robust to price jumps. 
The difference between RV and MedRV is an estimate of the realized jump 
variability. Disentangling the continuous and jump components in RV 
can lead to more precise volatility forecasts, 
as shown in Andersen et al. (2007) and Corsi et al. (2008).
